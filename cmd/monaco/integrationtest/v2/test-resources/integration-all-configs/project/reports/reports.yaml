    parameters:
      dashboardId: ["dashboard","dashboard","id"]

# TODO: this is skipped as v2 does currently not allow for a name to be reference. TBD if we actually want this!
# see: cmd/monaco/integrationtest/v1/test-resources/integration-all-configs/project/reports/reports.yaml for how it would work
